### Installation

```sh
$ npm i @ngx-admin-panel/core
$ npm i @ngx-admin-panel/components
```

You could only install the core functionalities if you'd like to,

```sh
$ npm i @ngx-admin-panel/core
```

For example to use the State or Block feature in your already running Angular admin panel. 

Components won't work without the core library though.
