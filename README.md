# LibraryWorkspace

This was actually a thesis project but since it was really useful and a time saver specially for personal projects, i updated it to use @akveo Ngx-admin in combination with @Nebular css library, this framework looks great and it's pretty straight forward as well, [One of my personal project uses it](https://www.theelderscrollsonline.gameitemprices.com), if something is missing (there are plenty of missing features, i'll be adding some issues and features when i have some time), feel free to PR it.
